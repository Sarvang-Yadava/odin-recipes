    <h2><u>Description</u></h2> 
    <p>Ramen is a Chinese noodle dish popularized in Japan. It includes Chinese-style wheat noodles served n several flavors of broth. Common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with toppings including sliced pork, nori which is dried seaweed and bamboo shoots and scallions. Nearly every region of Japan has its own variation now such as tonkotsu(pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. The recipe I'll be writing below will be one of many.</p>
